0.6.1 Richard Moore, rich@kde.org
	- Killed statusbar.h (it was unused but still in cvs)
	- Appled some fixes based on a patch from Otto Bruggeman
	  <bruggie@home.nl>

0.6 Richard Moore, rich@kde.org
	- Fixed the canvas size dialog crash when using fixed aspect ratio
	- Rewrote layout code for the info dialog and tidied it up (no
	  new messages). The old code crashed when 'keep aspect' was used.
	- Removed view.cpp/h as they were remanents of the pre-QScrollView
	  days
	- Made the mainview class center the canvas when there is space
	- Cleaned up some risky string handling
	- Don't show the paste tool in the tool menu etc. as it is special
	- Use the clipboard properly (eg. now supports the Print Screen
	  shortcut)
	- Removed the 'Edit Mask' action as whoever added the action didn't
	  get as far as writing any implementation.
	- Added a KStdAction::acualSize() action to the view menu.
	- Tidied the code up a little
	- Removed pointless widgets
